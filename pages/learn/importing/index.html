### Importing
#### Overview

The importer lets you import Sketch or Photoshop documents directly into Framer. All of your layer groups will be available. Your layer hierarchy is respected and all flattened layers are exported too. 

---

##### Get Started
To import layers, click the "Import" icon in the toolbar.

You'll be presented with the Import Sheet, where you can import designs directly out of Sketch, Sketch Beta and Photoshop. 
The import sheet also informs you about the state of the applications:

- **Not running** <br> The app isn't open.
- **Open a saved document** <br> Either you have no document open or your opened document hasn't been saved.

When you've opened a saved document, the Import button will become active and you'll see the title of your active document appear below the application title.

After importing, you'll see a few new lines of code appear:

<pre lang="coffeescript">
# This imports all the layers for "Prototype" into prototypeLayers
prototypeLayers = Framer.Importer.load "imported/Prototype"
</pre>

##### Re-Importing
Subsequent imports from the same file will work as long as you don't rename layers that you've already targeted within Framer. This allows for rapid iteration. CMD + Shift + I
