### Import Designs <a name="overview"></a>

With Framer, you can bring your static designs to life, using tools you’re already comfortable with. Import visual mockups from Photoshop or Sketch with a single click. Go back-and-forth and start exploring interactions, while further refining your visuals along the way. 

After importing, all your layers are selectable and have their position, hierarchy and masking set. With Framer, you don’t have to start from scratch, when you quickly want to validate an idea.

---

##### Get Started
Launch Framer Studio and open a saved .psd or .sketch file. Then, click the **Import** icon in the toolbar. You’ll be presented with a sheet. It tells you if there's a file open and ready to be imported. You can only import files that are saved.


<div class="inline-image"><img class="ss-import-sheet" src="/static/images/learn/ss-import-sheet.png" srcset="/static/images/learn/ss-import-sheet@2x.png 2x" draggable="false"></div>

### Group Layers
There are a few things you need to keep in mind when importing your Photoshop or Sketch files.

Select a layer and group it with **cmd+g**. Every group, with a single layer or more, gets flattened and imported into Framer. Layers that are not in a group are ignored. Pro tip: avoid spaces in the name of your group, it makes targetting them easier (spaces are converted to underscores).

<div class="inline-image"><img src="/static/images/learn/ss-layergroup.png" srcset="/static/images/learn/ss-layergroup@2x.png 2x" draggable="false"></div>

##### Selecting layers
After you’ve successfully imported a file, the following line of code gets inserted at the very top of your Framer prototype: 

<pre lang="coffeescript">
# This imports all the layers of design into designLayers
designLayers = Framer.Importer.load "imported/design"
</pre>

This loads and contains all of of the importer layers. We can give it any name, and use that to select layers. Let’s simply rename it to **import**. Now, to select a layer group that you’ve named **layerA**, you can write:

<pre lang="coffeescript">
# This imports all the layers of "design" into import
import = Framer.Importer.load "imported/design"

# Set the opacity of layerA 
import.layerA.opacity = 0.5
</pre>

Layer groups placed within other groups are called <a href="/docs/#layer.subLayers" target="_blank">subLayers</a>. In the example below, "groupA" has two subLayers. They can also be selected directly. There's no need for you to take the layer hierarchy into account.

<div class="inline-image"><img src="/static/images/learn/ss-target-hierarchy.png" srcset="/static/images/learn/ss-target-hierarchy@2x.png 2x" draggable="false"></div>


##### Selecting multiple layers

You can also select multiple layers. Perhaps you’d like to animate a couple of layers, or hide one of your layer groups.

This can be done with a <a href="http://framerjs.com/learn/coffeescript/loops-and-conditionals/" target="_blank">for-loop</a>. You can choose to select all of your imported layers, or just the layers of a specific group.

<div class="inline-image"><img src="/static/images/learn/ss-target-multiple.png" srcset="/static/images/learn/ss-target-multiple@2x.png 2x" draggable="false"></div>

<!-- <pre lang="coffeescript">
sketch = Framer.Importer.load "imported/design"

# Select all layers
for name, layer of sketch
	layer.opacity = 0.5

# Select subLayers of a group
for layer, index in sketch.groupB.subLayers
	layer.scale = 0.5
</pre> -->
