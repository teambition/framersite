###### layer.style <span>object</span>

Set or get css style properties for the layer.

Most of the style properties are managed by Framer internally so it is preferred that you use those when you can (for example layer.backgroundColor vs layer.style["background-color"]). The reason for this is that it's slow to read the values from the dom so to keep animations fast we keep a cache.

Next to the standard css property names you can also camelCase naming. So layer.style["border-color"] is the same as layer.style.borderColor. For a full list see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference">this overview</a>.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layerA = new Layer()

# Modify a single style property
layerA.style["outline"] = "1px solid red"

# Modify set of style properties
layerA.style = {
	"outline": "1px solid red",
	"padding": "10px"
}

# Get a specific style property
print layerA.style["outline"]
# Output: "1px solid red"

</pre>
