###### layer.copy()

<p class="small">
	<strong>Returns:</strong> Layer object<br>
</p>

This will copy a layer and all it's sub layers. The layers will have all the same properties as their copied counterparts (same position and looks). The event listeners will not be copies.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layerA = new Layer()
layerB = new Layer({superLayer:layerA})

layerC = layerA.copy()
</pre>
