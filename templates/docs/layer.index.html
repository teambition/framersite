###### layer.index <span>number</span>
<a id="layer.index"></a>
The order index for this layer. Sibling layers with a higher index (and the same z value) will drawn on top of this layer, and those with a lower index below.

The layer index increases by order of insertion. So if you add a layer as a sublayer and the highest sibling index value is 5, the index of the inserted layer will be 6 (5 + 1). Or, the last inserted layer will always be on top.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layerA = new Layer()
layerB = new Layer()

# Draw layerB on top
layerA.index = 2
layerB.index = 1
</pre>
