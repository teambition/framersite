###### layer.states.next(states <span>array</span>)
<a id="layer.states.next"></a>
Switches to the next state. If we reach the end of the states we start at the beginning again. You can provide an array of state names for the ordering. If you don't provide an array with state names it will use the ordering by when a state got added.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layerA = new Layer()

layerA.states.add({
	stateA: {x:500, opacity:0.5},
	stateB: {x:200, opacity:1},
})

# Every time we call this we cycle through the states
layerA.states.next(["stateA", "stateB"])
</pre>
