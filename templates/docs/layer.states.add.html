###### layer.states.add(name <span>string</span>, state <span>object</span> | states <span>object</span>)
<a id="layer.states.add"></a>
Adds a layer state. Each layer state is a collection of layer properties and values. You can add them one by one with a name and property object or all at once with an object containing the layer names and properties.

There is always a "default" state, containing the property values that the layer was created with.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layerA = new Layer()

# Add a single state
layerA.states.add("stateA", {x:500, opacity:0.5})

# Add a multiple states
layerA.states.add({
	stateA: {x:500, opacity:0.5},
	stateB: {x:200, opacity:1},
})
</pre>
